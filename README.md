# Safilo-Problem

For this work i used **FICO XPRESS MOSEL** and tried to solve an optimization problem based on Safilo Group data.

In the repository you can find:
- a .dat file with the problem data
- a .mos file with the code 
- a .docx file with the problem description and the mathematical assumption made
